  - It appears that riderships on Fridays of September do not vary from
    week to week and from Thursday to Friday.
  - The total number of passenders in the week of April 22 does not seem
    to be different from the total in other weeks in the same
month.

  - Election day ridership appears to be going up each year, but the
    ridership the week after the election day seems to be decreasing.
